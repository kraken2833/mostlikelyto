# 😈 Who's Most Likely To... (Web Game)

A chaotic, hilarious, and slightly dark browser-based party game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Players take turns guessing who in the group is "most likely to" do something outrageous, disgusting, or just plain suspicious—and whoever gets the most votes, drinks. Great for game nights, parties, or calling out your questionable friends in style.
